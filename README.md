## Affected Versions

SEB ≤ 3.5.0 (Windows)

## How It Works

1. Incorrect access control allows clipboard data sharing between SEB kiosk and the underlying system.
2. The exploit utilizes the pyperclip Python module to copy answers from a JSON file in the 'Answer-Key' directory, containing questions and answers.
3. In SEB kiosk mode:\
   The user copies the question.\
   The wmi Python module monitors system charge and discharge states to signal a Python script.\

4. Finally, the user pastes the answer from the clipboard into the answer field.

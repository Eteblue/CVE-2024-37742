# CVE-2024-37742: Clipboard Exploit in SEB ≤ 3.5.0 (Windows)

This repository contains a proof-of-concept (PoC) for exploiting CVE-2024-37742, a vulnerability in Safe Exam Browser (SEB) ≤ 3.5.0 on Windows. The vulnerability allows an attacker to share clipboard data between the SEB kiosk mode and the underlying system, compromising exam integrity. By exploiting this flaw, an attacker can bypass exam controls and gain an unfair advantage during exams.

**Note:** This PoC will only work in Windows Systems and SEB ≤ 3.5.0 (Windows)

Do not use this exploit maliciously or without permission. Use of this PoC is at your own risk. The author is not responsible for any damages or legal issues that may arise from the use of this information.

## How It Works

1. Inadequate access control allows clipboard data sharing between SEB kiosk and the underlying system.
2. The exploit utilizes the pyperclip Python module to copy answers from a JSON file in the 'Answer-Key' directory, containing questions and answers.
3. In SEB kiosk mode:
    The user copies the question.
    The wmi Python module monitors system charge and discharge states to signal a Python script.
    The script accesses clipboard data, searches the JSON file for the answer, and pastes it into the clipboard.
4. Finally, the user pastes the answer from the clipboard into the answer field.
